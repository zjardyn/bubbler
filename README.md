The goal of bubbler is to generate amplicon sequencing bubble and barplots 
that display community composition. This is a common visualization in microbial ecology studies, but current implementations are lack-luster, which has prompted me to develop bubbler. This package works alongside [phyloseq](https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq) and has been designed to work with 
data generated by [dada2](https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2). Future versions are planned
to work with [qiime2](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2) output. 

Features

- Sum relative abundance by sample or variable.
- Filter by taxonomic level and optionally, specific samples. 
- Pool taxa below a set threshold.
- Choose how many taxa you want to display. 

Future Features

- Arrange taxa in ascending or descending order. 
- *Italicize* genus and species-level taxonomies.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bubbler from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zjardyn/bubbler")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(bubbler)
a <- rel_abund(physeq1)
b <- choose_taxa_level(a, taxon_level = "Genus")
c <- choose_samples(b, c("Smp1", "Smp2", "Smp3", "Smp4"))
threshold <- choose_n_taxa(c, 5)
d <- pool_taxon(c, threshold)
```

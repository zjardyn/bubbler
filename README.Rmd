# bubbler

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of bubbler is to generate amplicon sequencing bubble and barplots 
that display community composition. This is a common visualization in microbial ecology studies, but current implementations are lack-luster, which has prompted me to develop bubbler. This package works alongside [phyloseq](https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq) and has been designed to work with 
data generated by [dada2](https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2). Future versions are planned
to work with [qiime2](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2) output. 

Features

- Sum relative abundance by sample or variable.
- Filter by taxonomic level and optionally, specific samples. 
- Pool taxa below a set threshold.
- Choose how many taxa you want to display. 

Future Features

- Arrange taxa in ascending or descending order. 
- *Italicize* genus and species-level taxonomies.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bubbler from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zjardyn/bubbler")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bubbler)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

# bubbler

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Bubbler is a tidy approach to community composition visualization of amplicon-sequencing datasets (16S/18S rRNA), which is inspired by Pat Schloss's implementation of stacked barcharts in his Coding Club Youtube [series](https://www.youtube.com/@Riffomonas). Bubbler generates relative abundance tables from ASV count data, taxonomic classification data, and meta data, to prepare data for high-quality visualizations. Bubbler is compatible with [dada2](https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2),  [qiime2](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2), and [phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/), making data import easy. 

## Installation

You can install bubbler from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)){
    install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("zjardyn/bubbler")
```

If you want to import data from phyloseq or qiime2, install these respective packages:

```r
# install phyloseq
if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager")){
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("phyloseq")

# install qiime2R
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)){
    install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("jbisanz/qiime2R")

```




<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->



<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->

# bubbler

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


Bubbler makes relative abundance tables for visualization of amplicon-sequencing (16S/18S rRNA) datasets. Bubbler combines asv counts, taxonomic information, and optionally, meta data to create stacked barcharts, or bubble plots. Bubbler works with [dada2](https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2),  [qiime2](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2), and [phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/ output. 

## Installation

You can install bubbler from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)){
    install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("zjardyn/bubbler")
```


<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->



<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
